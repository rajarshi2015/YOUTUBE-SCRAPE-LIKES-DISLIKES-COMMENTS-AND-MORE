:large_blue_circle:Components 

:round_pushpin:The first one Rajarshi youtube url links download.ipynb is the
python code to download links of all videos of any given channel
I have taken BBC Sports youtube channel


:round_pushpin:The second one Rajarshi.ipynb is where i have used a for loop
to iterate on these links one by one and scrape the required
elements to a dataframe which I then exported to a csv file.



 :large_blue_circle:CSV FILES:
 :round_pushpin:youtube_videos - Actual - This csv file contains all the url links
of BBC sports channel videos


 :round_pushpin:youtube_videos - This csv file was made because scraping just one url is
taking around 2-3mins, 500 urls thus would take a huge amount of time so
this csv is a sample of the "youtube_videos - Actual" containing 9 urls.


 :round_pushpin:FINAL OUTPUT - This csv file is the final output of the code with fields
as required.
